# FlickR.bundle
Plex Channel for FlickR Photos

Installation

Locate your Plex Media Server Plug-Ins folder:

\\<YourServer>\Plex\Library\Application Support\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins  

I have a Synology Disk Station where Plex is installed as a Package, so the location might be different depending on which flavour of Plex you have installed.  

Create a new sub folder called _FlickR.bundle_ and copy the _Contents_ folder from the GitHub repository into it.  You might need to reboot or restart the Plex server afterwards.  

If it doesn't work please have a look for the log in the following folder:  

\\<YourServer>\Plex\Library\Application Support\Plex Media Server\Logs\PMS Plugin Logs  

There should be a file called.com.plexapp.plugins.flickr in which hopefully will be a clue as to the problem.
